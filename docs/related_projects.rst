Trackeddy is an algorithm for eddy tracking and the extraction of
eddy properties using high resolution input like models (MOM5, MOM6,
ACCESS-OM2) and satellite data (AVISO+). This algorithm is running 
on NCI (Australia) resources such as raijin.

Active development is currently underway as part of
the PhD Josue Martinez-Moreno.
